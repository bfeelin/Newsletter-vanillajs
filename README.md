# Newsletter-vanillajs

In the HTML pane, add the necessary markup to recreate the newsletter component depicted in the image located at the top-right corner of the page. Style appropriately in the CSS pane.

This component should be fluid, meaning it will adjust to fit the width of its parent container.

We expect this exercise to take between 30-45 minutes, but take the time you need to submit work you're happy with.
